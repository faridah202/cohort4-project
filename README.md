### What I learned

I learnt about placing css class in bootstrap, that i had to put a class of what i wanted to style inside the bootstrap class/ like together.
```html
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-8 p-2 solid">
                <a href="#" target="blank"><img src="./work 7.png" class="img-fluid" alt="work 7" width="450"
                    height="250"></a>
                     #Solid here is a css class that leads to a an external css.
```
